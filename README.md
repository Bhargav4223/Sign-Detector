# Sign-Detection
## Sign-Detection an application of deep-learning is a real-time sign detector which detects different signs such as hello,thank you,i love you.
## This sign-detection is based on the opencv which detects the signs in real-time and this is trained with the real time images of those signs.
## This model can be scalable to different other signs as well.
## If you wish to use the model you can load action.h5 model into your local workspace and test it out.
# Thank You!
